## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

**Never report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** This could put users at risk.

### 2. Use our responsible disclosure process

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at: **security@neptune-core-wallet.com**

### 3. Include the following information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: OS, version, and other relevant details
- **Proof of concept**: If applicable, include a proof of concept

### 4. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- **Regular updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue

### 5. Responsible disclosure timeline

- **0-7 days**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
- **7-30 days**: Investigation and development of fix
- **30-60 days**: Testing and validation of fix
- **60+ days**: Coordinated public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep your wallet updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Verify downloads**: Always verify checksums and signatures
- **Secure your system**: Keep your operating system and software updated
- **Use strong passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for wallet encryption
- **Backup your wallet**: Regularly backup your wallet.dat file
- **Be cautious**: Never share your private keys or seed phrases

### For Developers

- **Follow secure coding practices**: Use the project's security guidelines
- **Validate all inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Use secure dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
- **Implement proper error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Use secure communication**: Always use HTTPS/TLS for network communication
- **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Only request necessary permissions

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Context isolation**: Electron renderer process is isolated from Node.js
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Secure storage**: Private keys are encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- **Network security**: All RPC communication uses proper authentication
- **Memory protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when no longer needed

### Cryptographic Security

- **Quantum-resistant cryptography**: Uses quantum-resistant algorithms where applicable
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Supports zk-STARKs for privacy-preserving transactions
- **Secure key derivation**: Uses PBKDF2 and Argon2 for key derivation
- **Encrypted storage**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- **Secure communication**: All network communication is encrypted

## Security Audits

We regularly conduct security audits of our codebase:

- **Automated scanning**: Continuous security scanning with GitHub Security Advisories
- **Dependency auditing**: Regular audits of all dependencies
- **Code review**: All code changes are reviewed for security implications
- **Penetration testing**: Regular penetration testing by security professionals
